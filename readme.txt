"Latent Unbalancedness in Three-Way Gravity Models" by Daniel Czarnowske and Amrei Stammann - Replication Package

R-Files:

helper_functions.R - contains the code for the bias-corrections of Weidner and Zylkin (2021), the algorithm to detect and drop perfectly predicted/separated observations, and the data generation for the simulation study.
empirical_example.R - generates Figure 1 plus Table 1 and Figure 3 (online supplement). Requires the data set from the replication package of Weidner and Zylkin (2021), https://www.dropbox.com/s/8zchjamfg2bqipd/Code%20repository%20for%20Weidner%20and%20Zylkin%20JIE%202021.zip?dl=0 
simulation_experiments.R - conducts the simulation study described in Section 3.
simulation_experiments_results.R - generates Figure 2 plus Table 2 (online supplement).

Folder:

figures/ - contains Figure 1-3 as pdf files.
